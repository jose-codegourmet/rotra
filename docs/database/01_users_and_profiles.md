# 01 — Users & Profiles

## Overview

Authentication is handled entirely by **Supabase Auth** using Facebook as the primary OAuth provider. An email invitation path also exists: an invite token is emailed to a recipient who then connects their Facebook account, after which Supabase verifies the linked email address.

The `profiles` table extends `auth.users` with all ROTRA-specific player data. All other tables reference `profiles.id`.

Account verification is a **three-condition composite** stored as a generated column (`is_verified`). New accounts are unverified by default. See `03_authentication.md` for the full verification model.

Gear items are modeled as independent rows (not JSONB) to allow querying, filtering, and clean relational joins. Each gear item can have multiple "where to buy" links via `gear_item_links`.

`player_self_assessments` holds the player's own skill dimension scores, set during profile setup and editable later. These are used as a baseline in the weighted skill rating until at least 5 external ratings accumulate per dimension.

## Table: `profiles`

Extends `auth.users`. Created automatically via a Supabase Auth trigger on new user signup (both Facebook login and email invitation paths).

```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id                              uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  is_verified                     bool GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
                                    facebook_id IS NOT NULL
                                    AND email_verified
                                    AND onboarding_completed

                                  ),

  -- Gamification totals (cached from exp_transactions / mmr_transactions)

);
```

### Column Notes

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `facebook_id` | Maps to the `sub` claim from Supabase's Facebook OAuth; stored for server-side deduplication. Always set; cannot be null on any real profile row. |
| `email` | Nullable. Populated from `auth.users.email` when the invitation path is used, or when the player links an email manually from settings. |
| `email_verified` | Set to `true` only after Supabase sends and the user clicks a verification email. Linking an email alone does not set this field. |
| `is_verified` | Generated column; never written directly. Clients must not cache or recompute this. |
| `age` | Private — must never appear on the public profile, leaderboard, or comparison views. |
| `playing_since` | Year the player started badminton. Null when `playing_since_less_than_one_year = true`. |
| `playing_since_less_than_one_year` | When `true`, `playing_since` must be null. Both are set together. |
| `tournament_wins_last_year` | Self-reported snapshot at registration. Not auto-recalculated. |
| `exp_total` and `mmr` | Cached aggregates from `exp_transactions` / `mmr_transactions`. Updated by trigger only; never written directly by the client. |
| `onboarding_completed` | Gates access. Any authenticated user with this `false` is redirected to `/onboarding` on every app open. |

### Trigger: auto-create profile on signup

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO profiles (id, facebook_id, name, avatar_url, email)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'provider_id',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url',
    NEW.email   -- populated on email invitation path; NULL on direct Facebook login
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();
```

### Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_facebook_id ON profiles(facebook_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_email       ON profiles(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_is_verified ON profiles(is_verified);
```

---

## Table: `email_invitations`

Tracks tokenized email invitations sent by admins or club owners. Each row represents a single invitation to a single email address. The token is single-use: once `status = 'accepted'`, it cannot be reused.

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_invitations (
  id            uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email         text NOT NULL,
  token         text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  invited_by    uuid REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

  status        invitation_status_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',

  -- Token expires 7 days after creation
  expires_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now() + interval '7 days',

  -- Set when the invitation is accepted
  accepted_by   uuid REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  accepted_at   timestamptz,

  created_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Status Transitions

```
pending → accepted  (recipient clicks link, completes Facebook login)
pending → expired   (TTL exceeded; a scheduled job or check-on-read marks this)
pending → revoked   (inviter or admin manually revokes before acceptance)
```

### Notes

- `invited_by` is nullable (SET NULL on profile delete) for audit preservation.
- `accepted_by` links to the `profiles` row created or updated when the invitation was accepted.
- When `status = 'accepted'`, the corresponding `profiles.email` is set to the invitation email and `profiles.email_verified` transitions to `true` once the Supabase verification link is clicked.
- A single email address may have multiple invitation rows (e.g. if an invite expired and a new one was issued), but only one `pending` invitation per email address is permitted at a time (enforced via a partial unique index).

```sql
-- Only one pending invite per email at a time
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email_invitations_pending_email
  ON email_invitations(email)
  WHERE status = 'pending';

CREATE INDEX idx_email_invitations_token  ON email_invitations(token);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_invitations_email  ON email_invitations(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_invitations_status ON email_invitations(status);
```

## Table: `gear_items`

Each gear item is a "mini post" on the player's public profile. Players can have multiple items per category.

```sql
CREATE TABLE gear_items (
  id          uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_id   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  category    gear_category_enum NOT NULL,

  -- Common fields
  title       text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  brand       text,
  model       text,

  -- Racket-specific
  balance_type    racket_balance_enum,
  string_brand    text,
  string_model    text,
  string_tension  numeric(5, 2),  -- e.g. 28.00 lbs
  grip            text,

  -- Shoes-specific
  shoe_size   numeric(4, 1),      -- e.g. 10.5
  fit_type    shoe_fit_enum,

  -- Bags-specific
  capacity    text,               -- e.g. "6-racket"

  display_order int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Notes

- Category-specific columns are `NULL` when not applicable (e.g. `shoe_size` is null on a racket row).
- `display_order` allows players to reorder items in their showcase.

### Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_gear_items_player_id ON gear_items(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_gear_items_category  ON gear_items(category);
```

---

## Table: `gear_item_links`

One-to-many "where to buy" URLs per gear item.

```sql
CREATE TABLE gear_item_links (
  id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  gear_item_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES gear_items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  label        text,   -- optional display label, e.g. "Lazada", "Shopee"
  url          text NOT NULL,
  created_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_gear_item_links_gear_item_id ON gear_item_links(gear_item_id);
```

---

## Table: `player_self_assessments`

The player's self-declared score per skill dimension, set during profile setup and editable later. One row per (player, dimension) pair.

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_self_assessments (
  id                      uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_id               uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  dimension_id            uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES skill_dimensions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  -- Score 1–5 matching the main skill scale
  score                   int NOT NULL CHECK (score BETWEEN 1 AND 5),

  -- Tracks when self-assessment weight phases out (≥5 external ratings per dimension)
  external_ratings_count  int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  updated_at              timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  UNIQUE (player_id, dimension_id)
);
```

### Notes

- `external_ratings_count` is incremented server-side when a new `match_review_ratings` row targeting this player and dimension is accepted within the 24-hour review window.
- Once `external_ratings_count >= 5`, the self-assessment weight drops from `×1` to `×0` in the weighted skill calculation (see `05_reviews_and_ratings.md`).

### Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_self_assessments_player_id    ON player_self_assessments(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_self_assessments_dimension_id ON player_self_assessments(dimension_id);
```

## Player Profile Completeness

The `profile_completed_bonus_claimed` flag is set to `true` (and a `+20 EXP` transaction is inserted) when all of the following are present and `profile_completed_bonus_claimed = false`:

| Requirement | Column / Table |
|---|---|
| Name set | `profiles.name` |
| Phone set | `profiles.phone` |
| Playing level set | `profiles.playing_level` |
| Format preference set | `profiles.format_preference` |
| Court position set | `profiles.court_position` |
| Play mode set | `profiles.play_mode` |
| Onboarding completed | `profiles.onboarding_completed = true` |

All of these fields are now collected during the onboarding wizard, so the bonus is awarded immediately on wizard completion for accounts created after the wizard ships.

---

## Account Verification Summary

| Condition | Column | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| Facebook linked | `profiles.facebook_id IS NOT NULL` | `handle_new_user()` trigger on OAuth signup |
| Email verified | `profiles.email_verified = true` | Supabase email verification callback |
| Onboarding complete | `profiles.onboarding_completed = true` | Server on wizard payload receipt |
| **Verified (composite)** | `profiles.is_verified` (generated) | Automatically when all three conditions are true |
