# 09 — RLS, Realtime & Storage

## Overview

This file documents:
1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** — access policies per table
2. **Supabase Realtime** — which tables are published and subscription patterns
3. **Storage** — Supabase Storage buckets for file uploads

RLS is the primary security boundary. All tables have RLS **enabled** with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. The application never bypasses RLS with a service role key on the client — service role is used only in Edge Functions and server actions.

---

## Helper Functions

These reusable functions are used across policy definitions.

```sql
-- Returns the authenticated user's UUID
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth_uid()
RETURNS uuid AS $$
  SELECT auth.uid();
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Returns true if the caller is an admin (custom JWT claim)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin()
RETURNS bool AS $$
  SELECT coalesce((auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin', false);
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Returns true if the caller is the Club Owner of the given club
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_club_owner(p_club_id uuid)
RETURNS bool AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM clubs
    WHERE id = p_club_id AND owner_id = auth.uid()
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Returns true if the caller is an active member of the given club (including the owner,
-- who is inserted into club_members with role = 'owner' on club creation)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_club_member(p_club_id uuid)
RETURNS bool AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM club_members
    WHERE club_id = p_club_id
      AND player_id = auth.uid()
      AND status = 'active'
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Returns true if the caller is a Que Master of the given club
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_que_master(p_club_id uuid)
RETURNS bool AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM club_members
    WHERE club_id = p_club_id
      AND player_id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'que_master'
      AND status = 'active'
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Returns true if the caller is an active participant of the given session
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_session_participant(p_session_id uuid)
RETURNS bool AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM session_registrations
    WHERE session_id = p_session_id
      AND player_id = auth.uid()
      AND admission_status IN ('accepted', 'reserved')
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## RLS Policies

### `profiles`

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Users can only update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_own"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (id = auth_uid());

ALTER TABLE platform_config ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE moderation_flags ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ranking_tier_config ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "admin_only_tier_config"     ON ranking_tier_config     FOR ALL USING (is_admin());

-- skill_dimensions: admin writes, any authenticated user reads (needed for review UI)
CREATE POLICY "skill_dimensions_select_any" ON skill_dimensions FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "skill_dimensions_admin_write" ON skill_dimensions FOR ALL USING (is_admin());

-- ranking_tier_config: admin writes, any authenticated user reads (needed for tier display)

-- sandbagging_flags: visible to admins, Club Owners (for their club), and Que Masters
CREATE POLICY "sandbagging_flags_select"
  ON sandbagging_flags FOR SELECT
  USING (
    player_id = auth_uid()
    OR is_admin()
    OR (club_id IS NOT NULL AND (is_club_owner(club_id) OR is_que_master(club_id)))
  );

-- Players can submit their own Club Owner application
CREATE POLICY "club_apps_insert_self"
  ON club_owner_applications FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (player_id = auth_uid());

CREATE POLICY "club_apps_select_own"
  ON club_owner_applications FOR SELECT
  USING (player_id = auth_uid() OR is_admin());
```

## Supabase Realtime

Realtime is configured via Supabase's publication system. Only the tables that need live sync are published.

```sql
-- Add tables to the supabase_realtime publication
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE queue_sessions;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE session_registrations;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE matches;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE match_players;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE notifications;
```

### Subscription Patterns

| Actor | Table | Filter | Events |
|---|---|---|---|
| All session participants | `queue_sessions` | `id=eq.{sessionId}` | `UPDATE` |
| All session participants | `session_registrations` | `session_id=eq.{sessionId}` | `INSERT`, `UPDATE` |
| All session participants | `matches` | `session_id=eq.{sessionId}` | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |
| All session participants | `match_players` | match via session join | `INSERT`, `UPDATE` |
| Authenticated users | `notifications` | `recipient_id=eq.{userId}` | `INSERT` |

### Client Subscription Example (Queue Session)

```typescript
// Subscribe to all match changes within a session
const channel = supabase
  .channel(`session:${sessionId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'matches',
    filter: `session_id=eq.${sessionId}`,
  }, (payload) => {
    // Update local match state
  })
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'session_registrations',
    filter: `session_id=eq.${sessionId}`,
  }, (payload) => {
    // Update player status / payment / waitlist
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### Reconnection Strategy

Supabase Realtime handles reconnection automatically. When a client reconnects after a gap, it should:
1. Re-fetch the full current state via REST (not rely on missed events)
2. Re-subscribe to the channel
3. Show an "out of sync" banner while reconnecting

---

## Storage Buckets

Supabase Storage is used for user-uploaded files.

### Buckets

| Bucket | Purpose | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `avatars` | Player profile photos | Public read; authenticated write (own folder only) |
| `club-images` | Club avatar / banner images | Public read; Club Owner write |

### Bucket Policies

```sql
-- avatars bucket: players upload to their own subfolder
-- Path pattern: avatars/{userId}/{filename}
INSERT INTO storage.policies (bucket_id, name, definition)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'Users upload own avatar',
  $$
    (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1])
  $$
);

-- club-images bucket: Club Owners upload for their clubs
-- Path pattern: club-images/{clubId}/{filename}
-- Policy enforced via a storage function that checks clubs.owner_id
```

### Image Handling Notes

- Supabase Storage Transforms can serve resized thumbnails (e.g. `?width=64&height=64` for avatar thumbnails in lists).
- Raw URLs are stored in `profiles.avatar_url` and `clubs.avatar_url` as the full Supabase Storage public URL.
- Gear item photos are **not** in MVP scope — only text fields and purchase links.

---

## Migration Order

Migrations must be applied in dependency order:

```
0001_enums.sql                  — all ENUM type definitions
0002_users_and_profiles.sql     — profiles, gear_items, gear_item_links, player_self_assessments
0003_clubs.sql                  — clubs, club_members, club_join_requests, club_blacklist, club_membership_audit_log
0004_queue_sessions.sql         — queue_sessions, session_registrations
0005_matches.sql                — matches, match_players
0006_reviews_and_ratings.sql    — skill_dimensions, match_reviews, match_review_ratings, player_skill_ratings
0007_gamification.sql           — exp_transactions, mmr_transactions, ranking_tier_config, sandbagging_flags
0008_notifications.sql          — notifications
0009_admin.sql                  — club_owner_applications, kill_switches, platform_config, moderation_flags
0010_rls_policies.sql           — all RLS policies and helper functions
0011_realtime.sql               — publication configuration
0012_storage.sql                — bucket creation and policies
seed.sql                        — skill_dimensions, ranking_tier_config, kill_switches, platform_config
```
