# Client App — Business Logic

The Client App is the primary user-facing product. It serves three types of users — **Players**, **Club Owners**, and **Que Masters** — and contains everything needed to run, attend, and track badminton sessions.

---

## Who Uses This App

| User | What They Do |
|------|-------------|
| **Player** | Joins clubs, registers for sessions, views queue position, reviews matches, tracks stats |
| **Club Owner** | Creates clubs, manages members, assigns Que Masters, views financials |
| **Que Master** | Sets up sessions, manages the match queue, tracks payments, assigns umpires |

> Quick Umpires and Admins interact via their own dedicated apps. See [`../umpire_app/`](../umpire_app/README.md) and [`../admin_app/`](../admin_app/README.md).
