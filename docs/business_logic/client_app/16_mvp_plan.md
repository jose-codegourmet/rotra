# 16 — MVP Plan

## Overview

Development is split into three phases. Each phase builds on the previous and is designed to be independently shippable and valuable. The goal is to get a working, useful product into users' hands as quickly as possible, then layer complexity.

---

## Phase 1 — Core System

**Goal**: End-to-end queue session management. A Que Master can run a complete badminton session through the app — from setup to match finalization — without needing a whiteboard, group chat, or paper list.

**Definition of Done for Phase 1**: A Club Owner can create a club, a Que Master can run a session from start to finish, and players can join, see their queue position, and have their match recorded.
