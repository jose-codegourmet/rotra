# 05 — Player Profile System

## Overview

Every player has a persistent profile that travels with them across all clubs and sessions. The profile serves as their **badminton identity** — visible to other players, Que Masters, and Club Owners. It combines self-declared information, system-computed statistics, and optional gear showcases.

---

## 5.1 Basic Profile

Seeded from Facebook on first login. Phone number and profile onboarding fields are collected via the post-OAuth onboarding screens (`/onboarding/phone` and `/onboarding/profile`). All fields except Joined Date are editable.

| Field | Source | Editable | Visibility | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Display name | Facebook `name` (confirmed at onboarding) | Yes | Public | Shown in all queue and leaderboard views |
| Profile photo | Facebook photo | Yes | Public | Can upload a custom photo |
| Playing level | Self-set | Yes | Public | Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced |
| Phone number | Collected at `/onboarding/phone` | Yes | Private | Required; not shown on public profile |
| Age | Collected at `/onboarding/profile` | Yes | Private | Integer 13–99; never shown publicly |
| Playing since | Collected at `/onboarding/profile` | Yes | Public | Year started or "Less than 1 year"; shown as "Playing since YYYY" |
| Tournament wins last year | Collected at `/onboarding/profile` | Yes | Public | Self-reported snapshot; shown as a badge (omitted if `none`) |
| Joined date | System | No | Public | Date of first login |

### Playing Level

Playing level is the player's **self-declared skill tier**. It is distinct from the computed Skill Rating (see `06_skill_rating.md`), which is derived from match data and peer assessments.

| Level | Intended For |
|-------|-------------|
| Beginner | New to the sport or just learning fundamentals |
| Intermediate | Can rally consistently; understands basic strategy |
| Advanced | Competitive; strong technical and tactical ability |

The system may **override the displayed level** if anti-sandbagging detection flags a significant discrepancy between self-declared level and computed rating. In that case, the system-computed level is shown publicly, and the self-declared level is retained internally.

## 5.2 Play Style

Informational preferences that help Que Masters and teammates understand a player's tendencies. These do not affect queue priority or any algorithm.

| Preference | Options | Source | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| Format | Singles / Doubles / Both | Self-set (Profile Settings) | Multiple selections allowed |
| Court position (doubles) | Front / Back / All-Around | Collected at `/onboarding/profile` Step 4 | Single-select; "All-Around" is the UI label for internal value `all_around` (equivalent to "Both" in prior logic) |
| Play mode | Competitive / Social / Both | Self-set (Profile Settings) | Multiple selections allowed |

Court position is collected during the onboarding wizard and pre-populates this section. Players can update all play style preferences at any time from Profile Settings or the Play Style section of the own-profile screen.

---

## 5.3 Gear Showcase

Players can build a public gear list. Each gear category supports **multiple items**, and each item behaves like a mini post with a title, description, and optional purchase links.

Categories: **Rackets**, **Shoes**, **Bags**

Items are visible on the public profile. They are purely social and informational — no gameplay implications.

### Legacy / null field display

Their public profile shows "Not set" for these fields alongside a contextual "Complete your profile" prompt that links to Profile Settings.

## 5.7 Player Comparison

Any authenticated player can compare two players side by side using the comparison feature. The comparison surfaces only data that is already publicly visible on each player's individual profile, and applies each section's visibility gate independently per player.

See [`19_player_comparison.md`](./19_player_comparison.md) for the full specification, including head-to-head record, skill radar overlay, advanced stats comparison, and sharing rules.
