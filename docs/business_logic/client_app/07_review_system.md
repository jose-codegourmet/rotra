# 07 — Review System

## Overview

The Review System handles all post-match feedback. It serves two purposes:

1. **Skill ratings** — numeric 1–5 scores that feed into each player's rolling skill rating (see `06_skill_rating.md`)
2. **Behavioral record** — optional text reviews that form a player's reputation over time

Reviews are submitted within a **24-hour window** after a match is marked complete. They are separate from the match completion check — a match can be complete before all reviews are submitted.

## 7.1 Who Can Submit Reviews

| Reviewer | Reviews Who | Includes Score | Includes Text |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Player (in the match) | Every other player in the same match | Yes (1–5) | Yes (optional, anonymous) |
| Que Master | Every player in the match | Yes (1–5) | Yes (optional, not anonymous) |
| Assigned Umpire | Every player in the match | Yes (1–5, optional) | No |
| Quick Umpire (logged in) | Every player in the match | Yes (1–5, optional) | No |
| Quick Umpire (guest / not logged in) | — | No | No |

* Umpire's **primary responsibility** is submitting the final score (required for match completion when assigned)
* Umpire skill rating submission is **optional** — they may skip it
* A **Quick Umpire who is not logged in** submits scores only — no review prompt is shown and no rating data is recorded
* Que Master's text note is attributed (not anonymous) — the reviewed player sees it was from the Que Master

---

## 7.2 Player → Player Reviews

### Skill Rating

* Submitted as a whole number from 1 to 5
* Not attributed to the submitter — shown only as part of the player's aggregate
* Cannot be submitted for yourself

### Text Review (Anonymous)

* Optional free-text field
* Character limit: 280 characters
* The reviewed player sees the text but **not who wrote it**
* Before a player views their text reviews, they must acknowledge a warning:
  > "These reviews were written by other players after matches and may contain critical feedback."
* After acknowledgment, reviews are shown — the acknowledgment is persistent (shown once per player)
* Text reviews are aggregated chronologically; there is no filter by match or author

### Submission Timing

* Prompt appears immediately after the match is marked complete
* Player can dismiss the prompt and return later (within the 24-hour window)
* A reminder notification is sent 2 hours before the window closes (see `15_notifications.md`)

---

## 7.3 Que Master Reviews

* Que Master rates each player in the match on a 1–5 scale
* Optional short note (up to 140 characters, not anonymous)
* Can be submitted at the time of finalization or any time within the 24-hour window
* Que Master's rating carries the **highest weight** (×3) in the skill calculation
* If the Que Master also participated as a player in the match, they can still submit ratings for other players — but their own player review scores are treated with standard weight

---

## 7.4 Umpire Reviews

There are two types of umpires, each with different review capabilities:

---

### 7.4.1 Assigned Umpire (Authenticated Session Participant)

* Must submit the **official final score** via the Umpire View — this is required to trigger match completion
* The scoring interface is described in `08_queue_session.md` §8.9
* After submitting the score, the umpire is prompted to optionally rate each player (1–5)
* Rating is optional; declining does not affect match completion status
* Umpire rating carries **high weight (×3)**, equivalent to Que Master
* The 24-hour review window applies — rating can be submitted after the prompt is dismissed

---

### 7.4.2 Quick Umpire — Logged In

A Quick Umpire who **has an active authenticated session** (i.e. was already logged in when they opened the Quick Umpire link) retains partial review capabilities:

* Can submit the official final score via the Umpire View
* After score submission, is prompted to optionally rate each player (1–5)
* Rating is **optional** and carries the same high weight (×3) as an Assigned Umpire
* Cannot submit text reviews
* The 24-hour review window applies

> The system detects the logged-in state at the time the Quick Umpire token is opened. If the user logs in *after* opening the link, review access is **not** retroactively granted for that session.

---

### 7.4.3 Quick Umpire — Guest (Not Logged In)

A Quick Umpire who opens the link **without an authenticated session**:

* Can score the match and submit the final score via the Umpire View
* **No review prompt is shown** after score submission
* No player ratings are recorded from this umpire
* Score is submitted directly to the Que Master (same notification flow)
* No review window opens; no EXP or rating impact from this umpire

```
Guest Quick Umpire Flow:
  Open link → Score match → Submit score → Done
  (No review step, no login prompt)
```

---

## 7.5 Review Moderation

### Profanity Filter

* Applied automatically when a text review is submitted
* Uses a configurable word blocklist (maintained by Admin)
* If the review fails the filter:
  * The submission is rejected with a clear error message
  * The player is prompted to edit and resubmit
  * The review is not saved in any form

### Flagging (Future — Phase 2)

* Players can flag a received review as inappropriate
* Flagged reviews are queued for Club Owner review
* Club Owner can dismiss the flag (keep the review) or remove it
* Admin can remove reviews platform-wide
* Repeated abusers can have review submission privileges suspended by Admin

---

## 7.6 Match Completion Logic

A match transitions from **In Progress** to **Complete** when all of the following are satisfied:

```
IF umpire is assigned to this match:
    umpire has submitted the final score

AND one of the following:
    all players in the match have submitted their reviews
    OR the Que Master has manually finalized the match
```

### Que Master Finalization

* Que Master can tap "Finalize Match" at any point after the umpire score is submitted (if applicable)
* This overrides the waiting-for-reviews condition and marks the match complete immediately
* Use case: players leave the venue without reviewing, or the session is running behind schedule
* Reviews can still be submitted after Que Master finalization (within the 24-hour window) — they update the skill ratings retroactively but do not change the match completion status

---

## 7.7 Match Completion Flow (Sequence)

### Standard (Assigned Umpire or Quick Umpire — Logged In)

```
1. Match ends on court (Umpire stops scoring / Que Master ends match)
2. Umpire taps "Submit Final Score" in the Umpire View
3. Score locked → Que Master notified
4. All players receive a review prompt in-app
5. 24-hour review window opens
6. Players, Que Master, and Umpire submit their reviews
7. One of:
      a. All players submit → match auto-completes
      b. Que Master taps "Finalize" → match force-completes
8. System updates:
      - Leaderboard (wins/losses recorded)
      - Player statistics (games played, win rate)
      - Skill ratings (ratings applied to rolling average)
      - EXP distributed to all participants
9. Notification sent to all participants: "Match complete. Leaderboard updated."
```

### Quick Umpire — Guest (Not Logged In)

```
1. Match ends on court
2. Guest Quick Umpire taps "Submit Final Score" in the Umpire View
3. Score locked → Que Master notified
4. No review prompt shown to the Quick Umpire (guest — no account)
5. All players still receive their own review prompt in-app (unchanged)
6. 24-hour review window opens for players and Que Master only
7. Match completion logic proceeds normally (no umpire review expected)
8. System updates as above
```

## 7.8 Review Data Model (Summary)

Each submitted review record contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Match ID | Which match this review belongs to |
| Reviewer ID | Who submitted it (null for guest Quick Umpire — no review record created) |
| Reviewed player ID | Who is being rated |
| Reviewer type | `player` / `que_master` / `umpire_assigned` / `umpire_quick_auth` |
| Skill rating | 1–5 (nullable — umpire may skip) |
| Text review | String (nullable — optional for player and Que Master types only) |
| Submitted at | Timestamp |
| Moderation status | `clean` / `flagged` / `removed` |

> Guest Quick Umpires do not produce a review record. Their score submission is stored on the match itself (not in the review table), attributed as `score_source: quick_umpire_guest`.
