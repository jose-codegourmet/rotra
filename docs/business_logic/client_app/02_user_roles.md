# 02 — User Roles

## Overview

The app has four roles. All users start as **Players** upon registration. Elevated roles are granted additively — holding a higher role in one club does not change your role in another.

```
── CLIENT APP ──────────────────────────────────────
  Player (default)
    └── Club Owner (approved)
          └── Que Master (assigned per club)

── UMPIRE APP ──────────────────────────────────────
  Quick Umpire (temporary, match-scoped — no account required)

── ADMIN APP ───────────────────────────────────────
  Admin (platform-level, future)
```

## 2.2 Club Owner / Host

An elevated role for players who want to create and manage a badminton club.

### How to Become One

* Role is **not self-assignable** — requires approval
* Player submits a request including:
  * Intended club name
  * Brief description of the club's purpose/context
* Request is reviewed manually at: `jose@codegourmet.io`
* Once approved, the player gains Club Owner capabilities for any clubs they create

> Approval will be handled by the Admin module in a future phase (see 2.4).

### Capabilities

Inherits all Player capabilities within their own club, plus:

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Create clubs | Can own and manage multiple clubs |
| Edit club settings | Name, description, membership settings |
| Delete clubs | Deletes all sessions and history under it |
| Configure membership settings | Auto-approve ON/OFF, Invite link ON/OFF |
| Invite players directly | Search by name/profile and send invite |
| Approve or reject join requests | With optional note to the player |
| Remove members | Can remove any non-owner member |
| Assign Que Master role | To any number of active club members simultaneously |
| Revoke Que Master role | One or all Que Masters, at any time |
| Oversee all sessions | View all session data under their clubs |
| View payment & attendance summaries | Per-session overview |
| View Club Statistics | Membership analytics and financial summaries (see below) |
| Manage Blacklist | Add or remove players from the club blacklist |

#### Club Statistics View

The Club Owner has access to a **Statistics tab** in the club management panel:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| New members | Count of members who joined within a selected time range |
| Consistent members | Members who attended ≥ 3 sessions in the last 30 days (threshold configurable) |
| Members via invite link | Count and list of members who joined through the invite link / QR code |
| Spending per session | Court cost, shuttle cost, total, and markup per queue schedule |
| Aggregate financials | Total spent, total collected, outstanding, and markup "profit" across configurable time ranges (per session / 7d / 30d / 90d / month / year / all time / custom) |
| Blacklisted players | View and manage the club's blacklist |

#### Blacklist Management

* Club Owner can blacklist any player (current member must be removed first)
* Blacklisted players are silently blocked from all entry points (invite link, join request, direct invite)
* Blacklist is per-club only — no effect on the player's other clubs
* Club Owner can remove a player from the blacklist at any time (does not re-add them to the club)
* All blacklist actions are logged with timestamp and optional internal note

### Limitations

* Cannot assign themselves as Que Master via the system — they may run sessions as owner but Que Master assignments are for other members
* Club Owner status in Club A grants no elevated privileges in Club B (unless they own Club B too)
* Cannot approve their own Club Owner application
* Cannot blacklist a player who is currently an Active Member — must remove first, then blacklist
