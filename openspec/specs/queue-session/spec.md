# Queue Session Specification

## Purpose

Client queue-session discovery, casual session creation, live lobby/console reads, mock join/waitlist screens, a mock attendance check-in screen, a mock QM Court View, and a mock QM Queue View in `apps/client`. Players can find open/active sessions, create a Quick Session, start/close as host, and leave. Standalone `/sessions/join` and `/sessions/joined` screens render the Smash Hub Ortigas fixture; JOIN does not persist a registration. Standalone `/sessions/attendance` renders the Smash Hub Ortigas attendance fixture; I AM IN is a client-only toast and local arrived flip. Standalone `/sessions/court` renders the Smash Hub Ortigas court fixture; HOLD COURT 1 is a client-only toast and local On Hold flip. Standalone `/sessions/queue` renders the Smash Hub Ortigas queue fixture; SEND TO COURT 2 is a client-only toast. `GET /api/sessions/[id]` is still mock discovery only. There is no POST register/waitlist, attendance, court, or queue API. The prepared-flow step is shown locked and is not implemented. Umpire/QR scoring is not implemented in the client.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Authenticated session APIs
Session APIs under `/api/sessions/*` MUST require a current profile. Missing auth SHALL return HTTP 401.

#### Scenario: Discover without a session
- GIVEN no current profile
- WHEN `GET /api/sessions/discover` is called
- THEN the API returns HTTP 401

### Requirement: Geo discovery
`GET /api/sessions/discover` SHALL require numeric `lat` and `lng`. It MUST return `{ sessions, venueGroups }` for `queue_sessions` with status `open` or `active` that are visible to the viewer. Sessions with visibility `club_members` SHALL be hidden unless the viewer is an active member of that `clubId`. Open sessions whose `dateTime` is more than 12 hours in the past SHALL be excluded. Missing coordinates SHALL return HTTP 400.

#### Scenario: Valid discovery query
- GIVEN a signed-in player and valid `lat`/`lng`
- WHEN they GET `/api/sessions/discover`
- THEN the response includes `sessions` and `venueGroups` from the database

#### Scenario: Missing coordinates
- GIVEN a signed-in player
- WHEN they GET `/api/sessions/discover` without `lat` and `lng`
- THEN the API returns HTTP 400

### Requirement: Available, my, and active session lists
`GET /api/sessions/available` SHALL list open/active sessions visible to the user (no geo filter). `GET /api/sessions/my` SHALL list sessions the user is registered for. `GET /api/sessions/active` SHALL return the best current or scheduled enrolled session where `admissionStatus` is `accepted`, `waitlisted`, or `reserved` and `playerStatus` is not `exited`, for sessions in `open` or `active`.

#### Scenario: Find-sessions available tab
- GIVEN a signed-in player
- WHEN `/find-sessions` loads the Available tab
- THEN it reads `GET /api/sessions/available`

#### Scenario: Dashboard active banner
- GIVEN the player has an accepted registration on an open or active session
- WHEN the dashboard loads
- THEN `GET /api/sessions/active` can return that session for the banner

### Requirement: Quick Session create
`POST /api/sessions/quick` SHALL validate the Quick Session form, optionally require an active `club_members` row when `clubId` is set (HTTP 403 otherwise), force `visibility` to `open` when there is no club, geocode the venue when coordinates are missing, and in one transaction create a `queue_sessions` row (`origin: player_organized`, `status: open`) plus a host registration with `admissionStatus: accepted`.

#### Scenario: Clubless quick session
- GIVEN a signed-in player
- WHEN they post a valid payload without `clubId`
- THEN a session is created with `visibility` `open`
- AND the host is registered as accepted
- AND the client navigates to `/find-sessions/{id}`

#### Scenario: Club-scoped session without membership
- GIVEN a `clubId` the player is not an active member of
- WHEN they post `/api/sessions/quick`
- THEN the API returns HTTP 403

### Requirement: Host start and close
`POST /api/sessions/[id]/start` SHALL allow only the `hostId`, and only when status is `open`, then set status to `active`. `POST /api/sessions/[id]/close` SHALL allow only the host, and only when status is `draft`, `open`, or `active`, then set status to `closed`. Wrong host SHALL return 403. Wrong status SHALL return 409. Missing session SHALL return 404.

#### Scenario: Host starts an open session
- GIVEN the current profile is the session host
- AND the session status is `open`
- WHEN they POST `/api/sessions/[id]/start`
- THEN the session status becomes `active`

#### Scenario: Non-host tries to start
- GIVEN a player who is not `hostId`
- WHEN they POST start
- THEN the API returns HTTP 403

### Requirement: Leave session
`POST /api/sessions/[id]/leave` SHALL set the viewer's registration to `playerStatus: exited` and `admissionStatus: exited`. Missing registration SHALL return 404. Already-exited SHALL return 409.

#### Scenario: Registered player leaves
- GIVEN the viewer has a non-exited registration
- WHEN they POST leave
- THEN that registration is marked exited

### Requirement: Live read models
`GET /api/sessions/[id]/live` SHALL return session context plus `viewerRegistration` (null when missing or exited). `GET /api/sessions/[id]/roster` SHALL return accepted and waitlisted players. `GET /api/sessions/[id]/console` SHALL return courts, queue, roster, and standings derived from `Match` rows and registrations. Missing sessions SHALL return 404.

#### Scenario: Live page routing
- GIVEN a session loaded via `/find-sessions/[sessionId]`
- WHEN status is `open` and the viewer is the host

It's free for the next pairing.`). The STATUS legend SHALL show ACTIVE, EMPTY, and ON HOLD. Sticky HOLD COURT 1 SHALL toast and flip Court 1 to ON HOLD locally (RESUME COURT 1 reverses that flip). It MUST NOT call a court API or write the database. There is no ADD MATCH control.

#### Scenario: Court view is standalone mock

### Requirement: Session-id join check remains mock-only
`GET /api/sessions/[id]` SHALL look up `MOCK_SESSION_DISCOVERY` only (HTTP 404 if absent, 410 if status is not `open` or `active`). There is no POST register/waitlist endpoint. The register button on the live `/find-sessions/[sessionId]` page SHALL be a no-op stub. Dashboard join that depends on the mock GET MAY report real database sessions as unavailable.

#### Scenario: Real session id on mock join check
- GIVEN a database session id that is not in `MOCK_SESSION_DISCOVERY`

## Documented product rules

The following rules come from `docs/business_logic/client_app/08_queue_session.md` (canonical Que Sessions). They are product intent and MUST NOT be treated as implemented unless a Current requirement above already states the same fact. Current discovery/create/start/close/leave and live reads are implemented; join, waitlist, attendance, court, and queue screens remain mock.

Automatic Queueing is specified separately in `automatic-queueing`.

### Requirement: Who may create (documented)
Documented product rule: only a Club Owner or Que Master may create a Club or Friendly Que Session. A regular Player cannot. Club Que Sessions SHALL require Session type MMR or Fun Games. Friendly Que Sessions SHALL be Regular (no EXP/MMR). Session type SHALL NOT change after Active or after any match has started.

> Current `POST /api/sessions/quick` allows any signed-in player to create a player-organized session. That Current behavior stands. `docs/business_logic.md` also still describes player-organized creation.

#### Scenario: Type locked after Active (documented)
- GIVEN a Club Que Session is Active
- WHEN a host tries to change Session type from MMR to Fun Games
- THEN the documented rule refuses the change

### Requirement: Lifecycle
Documented states SHALL be Draft → Open → Active → Closed → Completed, with Cancelled terminal from Draft, Open, or Active. Refunds SHALL be handled manually outside ROTRA. Enrollment alone SHALL NOT mean “in session” for dashboard LIVE/resume indicators until status is `active` or `open` with `dateTime <= now`.

#### Scenario: Future open Quick Session
- GIVEN the host published an `open` session with future `dateTime`
- WHEN the dashboard evaluates “in session”
- THEN the host is enrolled but not in-session until Start Session or start time

### Requirement: Admission, waitlist, and slots
Capacity SHALL be `players_per_court × number_of_courts`. Overflow SHALL be waitlisted FIFO. A player SHALL have exactly one admission state: Not Registered, Pending Approval, Accepted, Waitlisted, Declined, Withdrawn, Cancelled Registration, Removed, or Reserved. Pending Approval SHALL not occupy a slot.

#### Scenario: Ninth player
- GIVEN capacity 8
- WHEN a ninth player is approved
- THEN they are waitlisted

### Requirement: I Am In and cancellation
I Am In SHALL require a confirmation modal and SHALL be irreversible by the Player. There SHALL be no automatic no-show that removes Accepted players. Free cancellation cutoff SHALL be 5 hours before start; after cutoff and before I Am In, cancellation remains allowed but payment obligation remains unless the host confirms replacement. Early Exit after I Am In SHALL require payment confirmation.

#### Scenario: Player cannot undo I Am In
- GIVEN the player confirmed I Am In
- WHEN they try to revert themselves to Not Arrived
- THEN the documented rule requires Que Master or Club Owner correction

### Requirement: Password-protected sessions
Password-protected sessions SHALL store hashes only. After the first failed attempt, retries SHALL be rate-limited to one per 5 minutes on the backend. Authorization SHALL be per user per session and revoked on cancel, withdraw, or Early Exit.

#### Scenario: Rapid password guesses
- GIVEN one failed password attempt
- WHEN the player retries immediately
- THEN the backend refuses until 5 minutes have passed

### Requirement: Request a Match and Feed
Request a Match SHALL create a proposal only — it MUST NOT create an active match or bypass Match Queue order. Every field change and manual host announcement SHALL write a Session Feed entry.

#### Scenario: Request is not a match
- GIVEN a player submits Request a Match
- WHEN it is pending
- THEN no active match is created until Que Master approval

### Requirement: Multi-QM and realtime
All assigned Que Masters SHALL have identical session-management permissions. Only the Club Owner MAY add, remove, or replace Que Masters, including while Active. The server SHALL be authoritative; multi-QM edits SHALL be last-write-wins with an audit trail.

#### Scenario: QM cannot remove another QM
- GIVEN two assigned Que Masters
- WHEN one tries to remove the other
- THEN the documented rule refuses
